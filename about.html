        <p class="about"><em>League of Legends</em>(LOL) commonly referred to as <em>League</em> is a 2009 multiplayer online battle arena video game developed and published by Riot Games.
            Inspired by Defend of Ancients, a customer map for Warcraft 3, Riot's founders sought to developed a stand-alone game in the same genre.
            Since it's release in October 2009, the game has been free-to-play and is monetized through purchaseable character customization.
            The game is available for Windows and macOS.Summoner's Rift is the flagship game mode of League of Legends and the most prominent in professional-level play.
            The mode has a ranked competitive ladder; a matchmaking system determines a player's skill level and generates a starting rank from which they can climb. 
            There are nine tiers; the least skilled are Iron, Bronze, and Silver, and the highest are Master, Grandmaster, and Challenger.
            Two teams of five players compete to destroy the opposing team's "Nexus", which is guarded by the enemy champions and defensive structures known as "turrets".
            Each team's Nexus is located in their base, where players start the game or reappear after death.
            Non-player characters known as minions are generated from each team's Nexus and advance towards the enemy base along three lanes guarded by turrets: top, middle, and bottom.
            Each team's base contains three "inhibitors", one behind the third tower from the center of each lane. 
            Destroying one of the enemy team's inhibitors causes stronger allied minions to spawn in that lane, and allows the attacking team to damage the enemy Nexus and the two turrets guarding it.
            The regions in between the lanes are collectively known as the "jungle", which is inhabited by "monsters" that, like minions, respawn at regular intervals. 
            Like minions, monsters provide gold and XP when killed. Another, more powerful class of monster resides within the river that separates each team's jungle.
            These monsters require multiple players to defeat and grant special abilities to their slayers' team. 
            For example, teams can gain a powerful allied unit after killing the Rift Herald, permanent strength boosts by killing dragons, and stronger, more durable minions by killing Baron Nashor.            
            Summoner's Rift matches can last from as little as 15 minutes to over an hour.
            Although the game does not enforce where players may go, conventions have arisen over the game's lifetime: typically one player goes in the top lane, one in the middle lane, one in the jungle, and two in the bottom lane.
            Players in a lane kill minions to accumulate gold and XP (termed "farming") and try to prevent their opponent from doing the same. 
            A fifth champion, known as a "jungler", farms the jungle monsters and, when powerful enough, assists their teammates in a lane.</p>
