            This was probably my proudest moment playing this game.
            League of Legend has a player base of roughly around 11.5 million players.
            2017 League Of Legend was a very competitive year. 
            I was one of the top 500 players that reached Challenger during 2017 Season 7
            of LoL. I would casually meet professional players on a daily basis while playing the game.
